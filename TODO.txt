ireactable to do list
---------------------

- make a Pd patch that receives that OSC protocol
+ figure out how to dynamically connect Pd objects (DONE: throw~/catch~ blocks are probably better than send~/receive~)
+ create encapsulated versions of ireactable objects
- fix pwm~ to take signal input
+ make objects receive sum of signal input and control input for first parameter

- adapt iphone multitouch example app ("Touches")
- create images for 3 objects: squarewave, vcf, lfo
- create background image (blue with circles)

- install 3.0 beta on iphone
